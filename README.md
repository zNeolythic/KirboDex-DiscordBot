**Collect Kirbos on Discord like a trading card game!** Choose a spawn channel and wild Kirbos will spawn randomly when the chat is active. Catch them by guessing their name, collect them and trade them with other players! 

You can invite the official bot [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1249152060302037136). Note that no more collectibles will be added as bot support is no more.
